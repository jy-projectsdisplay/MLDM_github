ranking\n","\n","Feature Importance (FI) is **not** simply “counting how often a question appears”, and it is not a perfect “true ranking” either.\n","\n","In tree models, FI is based on **improvement** at splits.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### What FI actually measures (tree example)\n","\n","Each time the tree asks a question (feature), it makes a split.\n","\n","A “good” split is one that improves the quality of separation between classes, for example:\n","- the child nodes become more pure (less mixed classes)\n","- the model becomes more confident about the predicted class\n","\n","In many tree implementations, this improvement is measured using something like:\n","- **Gini decrease** (classification), or\n","- **entropy decrease** (information gain)\n","\n","So FI is closer to:\n","\n","> “How much did this feature improve the splits, summed over where it was used?”\n","\n","This is why FI is usually described as:\n","- **total decrease in impurity** contributed by the feature (often averaged across trees in a forest)\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Why FI is easier than reading the full tree\n","\n","Even in your laptop tree, you would need to track:\n","- where each feature is used\n","- how strong each split is\n","- how many records flow through that split\n","\n","Once the model becomes deeper, or becomes a forest (many trees), this is impossible to do manually.\n","\n","FI compresses all those split-level improvements into a short list like:\n","\n","1. `budget`\n","2. `gaming`\n","3. `dedicated GPU`\n","4. `battery`\n","5. `weight`\n","\n","This list is **a true ordinal ranking** of the model’s *split-improvement contributions*.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Why FI values are ordinal, not numeric in meaning\n","\n","FI usually produces numbers, for example:\n","\n","| Feature | FI |\n","|-------|----|\n","| budget | 0.42 |\n","| gaming | 0.27 |\n","| dedicated GPU | 0.19 |\n","| battery | 0.12 |\n","\n","It is tempting to treat these numbers mathematically, but this is **not correct**.\n","\n","Important points:\n","\n","- The FI values are **relative**, not absolute\n","- Adding them does not represent a real-world quantity  \n","  (0.27 + 0.19 has no interpretable meaning)\n","- The scale is model-dependent and dataset-dependent\n","\n","For example:\n","- An FI of 0.42 in one model does **not** mean the feature is “twice as important” as 0.21 in another model\n","- An FI of 0.30 in one dataset cannot be compared directly with 0.30 from another dataset\n","\n","This is because FI numbers come from **internal split improvements**, not from a universal unit.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### What you *can* and *cannot* do with FI numbers\n","\n","You **can**:\n","- compare features **within the same model**\n","- rank features from more important to less important\n","- identify dominant or weak signals\n","\n","You **cannot**:\n","- add FI values together\n","- compare FI values across different models or datasets\n","- interpret FI as probability, impact, or effect size\n","\n","This is why FI should be treated as a **true ordinal ranking tool**, not a precise numerical measurement.\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4681eb2e","metadata":{"id":"4681eb2e"},"source":["---\n","##Chapter 0) Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip -q install -U \\\n","

Data Quality Issues to Resolve Before Modelling\n","\n","#### Priority List:\n","\n","1. **Outliers Management**:\n","   - **Justification**: Several columns have detected outliers (measured using the IQR method). Outliers can skew the results of machine learning models, especially tree-based models. They can impact the model's learning process and lead to poor generalization.\n","   \n","2. **Feature Redundancy**:\n","   - **Justification**: High correlation between features (e.g., `mean radius` is highly correlated with `mean perimeter` and `mean area`) indicates redundancy. Including redundant features can add noise and increase the complexity of the model, potentially leading to overfitting.\n","\n","3. **Feature Scope Standardization**:\n","   - **Justification**: Feature scales vary significantly (e.g., `mean radius` ranges from 6.98 to 28.11, while `texture error` ranges from 0 to 4.89). While tree-based models are generally invariant to feature scaling, ensuring consistent ranges can improve interpretability and stabilize learning.\n","\n","4. **Null Values**:\n","   - **Justification**: Although all columns are reported with zero null values, it's always a good practice to validate this in the modeling environment before training to avoid unexpected runtime errors.\n","\n","5. **Feature Leakage**:\n","   - **Justification**: Even though no leakage columns are reported, continuous validation during exploratory analysis can help identify features that might be causing leakage during modeling, which results in misleading performance metrics.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Columns that Appear Redundant, Correlated, or Likely to Cause Leakage\n","\n","1. **Highly Correlated Columns**:\n","   - **Example**: `mean radius`, `mean perimeter`, and `mean area` show strong positive correlations (0.998, 0.987). Retaining all three could introduce redundancy and increase model complexity.\n","   - **Problematic Aspect**: They may lead to overfitting as the model may end up giving undue importance to multiple columns that convey similar information.\n","\n","2. **High Number of Unique Values**:\n","   - **Example**: Columns such as `radius error`, `texture error`, etc., have many unique values which might introduce noise if not properly addressed.\n","   - **Problematic Aspect**: Features with excessive unique values relative to rows can make learning inefficient, possibly leading to model instability.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Python Script to Handle Identified Issues\n","\n","```python\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Sample DataFrame for illustration\n","# df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')\n","\n","def handle_outliers(df, threshold=1.5):\n","    \"\"\" Remove outliers using the IQR method. \"\"\"\n","    for col in df.select_dtypes(include=[np.float64]).columns:\n","        Q1 = df[col].quantile(0.25)\n","        Q3 = df[col].quantile(0.75)\n","        IQR = Q3 - Q1\n","        lower_bound = Q1 - (threshold * IQR)\n","        upper_bound = Q3 + (threshold * IQR)\n","        df = df[(df[col] >= lower_bound) & (df[col] <= upper_bound)]\n","    return df\n","\n","def remove_redundant_features(df, threshold=0.9):\n","    \"\"\" Remove highly correlated features based on a correlation threshold. \"\"\"\n","    corr_matrix = df.corr().abs()\n","    # Get pairs of correlated features\n","    columns_to_drop = set()\n","    for i in range(len(corr_matrix.columns)):\n","        for j in range(i):\n","            if corr_matrix.iloc[i, j] > threshold:\n","                colname = corr_matrix.columns[i]\n","                columns_to_drop.add(colname)\n","    df = df.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)\n","    return df\n","\n","def standardize_features(df):\n","    \"\"\" Standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance. \"\"\"\n","    return (df - df.mean()) / df.std()\n","\n","def validate_nulls(df):\n","    \"\"\" Validate that there are no nulls present in the DataFrame. \"\"\"\n","    return df.isnull().sum().sum() == 0\n","\n","def data_preprocessing_pipeline(df, handle_outliers=True, handle_redundancy=True, standardize=True):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Wrapper function to call individual helper functions\n","    based on the user's choice.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if handle_outliers:\n","        df = handle_outliers(df)\n","    \n","    if handle_redundancy:\n","        df = remove_redundant_features(df)\n","\n","    if standardize:\n","        df = standardize_features(df)\n","    \n","    assert validate_nulls(df), \"Data contains null values!\"\n","    return df\n","\n","# Run the overall wrapper function\n","# df = data_preprocessing_pipeline(df, handle_outliers=True, handle_redundancy=True, standardize=True)\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Explanation of the Code:\n","\n","- **Outlier Handling**: Utilizes the IQR method to remove outliers from numeric features.\n","- **Redundant Feature Removal**: Drops features based on high correlation using a threshold.\n","- **Feature Standardization**: Centers and scales features for consistency.\n","- **Null Validation**: Asserts that there are no null values before modeling.\n","\n","Just uncomment the provided line at the end to run the preprocessing pipeline with custom user options.
